            /* Simple example of usage TrafficAlerts API (TA API)
             * This is the example of JS code, how to use the TA API to communicate with TrafficAlerts server to getting or emitting alerts in Real Time.
             * TrafficAlerts API is based on WebSockets and especially on Socket.IO library. For usage of this API you need to import this library. This example is including this library.           
             * The example is devided to two parts: 
             * 
             * 1. PART is the simple example, how to use Facebook login to get FB user access token, 
             * becouse this token you need to emit by TA API becouse of authentication on TA server.
             * 
             * 2. PART is the part of TA API. It showing how to emit commands and how to get responses from server in Real Time.

            /* 1. PART
             * FACEBOOK SDK FOR JAVASCRIPT
             * This part is the example from Facebook SDK documentation ( https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/login-flow-for-web/v2.2 )
             * It is the basic implementation how login user to application using Facebook. Facebook after sucesfull user login will 
             * provide you FB user access token which you need to pass across TrafficAlerts API (message 'log-me') if you want to use TrafficAlerts server part for your application.
             * For this Facebook login you need to have generated your Facebook APP id. If you don't have it yet you can get it on: https://developers.facebook.com/ 
             * Also you can get from this pages a lot of hints and help for future Facebook APP usage.
             * !!! Set your Facebook APP ID in line 64: "appId      : '{your-app-id}',"

             * Then we will wait when user will be authenticated by Facebook and in this time, we can start to communicate with Traffic Alerts server.  
             * 
             * Each received alert from server is specified like (object) which contains following properties
             * (object) alert                           
             *  alert.id                 - id of alert
             *  alert.facebook_app_id    - id of FB application in which, alert was published, thanks by this you can differentiate if alert is from your Facebook APP
             *  alert.lat                - latitude
             *  alert.lng                - longtitude
             *  alert.icon               - icon type [1, 2, 3, 4]
             *  alert.path               - relative path of alert image, if you want to show image in your site only join the server host part before image path
             *  alert.note               - note
             *  alert.owner              - (bool) true if this user and this Facebook APP is owner of thealert, false in another case
             *  alert.published          - MySQL DATETIME FORMAT yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ when alert was published
             *  alert.expire_on          - MySQL DATETIME FORMAT yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ when alert will expire
